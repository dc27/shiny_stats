__Definition__: A range of values likely to contain the population parameter.

For a confidence level of $x$ we expect that $x$ of the confidence intervals calculated using the same process to contain the population parameter. e.g. for a confidence level of $0.95$ we expect $0.95$ (or $95$ out of $100$) of the CIs to contain the population parameter (the true value of the mean.)

For the data below the population parameter is known to be $48.5$ (_Note: If we actually knew the population parameter there would no need for inferential statistics._)

Like the standard error, the width of Confidence Intervals (CIs) can be reduced by increasing the sample size ($n$). Try it out!
