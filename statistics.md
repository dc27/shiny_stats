A lot of this is directly lifted from [Wikipedia's article on Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics#Inferential_statistics)

> Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

Two main statistical methods are used in Data Analysis:

- __Descriptive Statistics__: which summarise data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation.
- __Inferential Statistics__: which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random vairation

The main distinction between __Inferential__ and __Descriptive__ statistics is that the aim of Descriptive Statistics is to summarise a _Sample_, rather than use the Sample to infer information about the _Population_ that the sample of data is thought to represent.

Note it is possible to use Descriptive Statistics to summarise a population, which is possible in closed environments. e.g. A bank will have access to the population of holders of their credit cards. They wouldn't however have access to the population of all credit card holders.

A descriptive statistic is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information, so descriptive statistics is the process of using and analysing those statistics.

Common descriptive statistics:

  - __Measures of Centrality__ (sometimes called _central tendency_):
      - mean
      - median
      - mode
  - __Measures of spread__ (sometimes called _dispersion_):
      - range
      - interquartile range
      - variance
      - standard deviation

Statistical inference is the process of using Data Analysis to deduce the properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential Statistics infers properties of a population. It is assumed that the observed data set (data we have access to) has been sampled from a larger population. This is in contrast to Descriptive Statistics, which does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

Common statistical inference practices:

  - hypothesis testing
  - calculating confidence intervals
  - analysis of variance
  - regression analysis

## Populations and Samples

#### Populations

A population represents all the objects, elements, or entities conceivably of interest for an investigative study.

From Wikipedia again: [Statistical Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population)

> A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker).[2] A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.

We will rarely have access to the data for an entire population, warranting the field of inferential statistics.

Population parameters are properties of the population such as:

  - µ : population mean
  - σ : population standard deviation
  - π : population proportion


#### Samples

A sample by contrast is a part or subset of the population. Statisticians and Analysts draw samples to calculate a sample statistic and infer information about the equivelant population parameter.

Sample Statistics / Point Estimates: properties of a sample, such as:

  - $\bar x$: sample mean
  - $S$: sample standard deviation
  - $\hat p$: sample proportion
